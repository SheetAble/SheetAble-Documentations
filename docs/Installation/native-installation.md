# Native Installation
Installing SheetAble natively only takes one step. You have to download the [binary file for your system](https://github.com/SheetAble/SheetAble-Documentations/releases).
After downloading it take it to your directory of choice and execute it.

SheetAble should be running successfully now. Try opening your browser at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to check if it worked
