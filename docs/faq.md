## Where can I report a bug?
To report a bug, please go over to our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/QnFbxyPbRj) where our Developer team currently active is.

## Will there be mobile support?
Our goal was from the beginning on to have SheetAble available on all your devices so you can also edit them on your Tablet/iPad and have them synchronized by your home server.

## Is there an early access version?
**Yes**, we will create an early access build before every release for our testers to test it and check it out. Sometimes there will be announcements on the [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/QnFbxyPbRj) if any new places opened up. So if you are interested you need to give yourself the `Early Access` role to get pinged on the annoucements.

## Will there be a paid version?
Our plan is to create a version of SheetAble which will have more functionalities. However there will always be a free version of SheetAble with a sufficient amount of functionalities. 

## Will SheetAble be open source?
The question if SheetAble will be open source is still under consultation. Until the decision is made only the Documentation will be open source.

## How can I help?
- Bringin new ideas to us via our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/QnFbxyPbRj)
- Fixing typos in our [Documentation](https://github.com/SheetAble/SheetAble-Documentations)
- Write new parts for our [Documentation](https://github.com/SheetAble/SheetAble-Documentations)
- SheetAble is currently in it's early ages of development, so not many people have heard about it. If you have any friends or family, who might be interested in such a product, please let them know.

## What if I don't have a home server? 
We are thinking about implementing a services for hosting your sheets by us. If you would be interested in such a thing, please let us know over the [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/QnFbxyPbRj), so we can plan out if we should implement such a service. 

You can also just rent a home server online and see if it would be in your interest to build one your own.
