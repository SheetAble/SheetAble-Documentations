# Introduction
SheetAble is an easy to use music sheet organiser and notation software available in your browser or on mobile devices. 
#### Usage
Currently the app can be installed on a home server, on your computer or on iOS/Android Tablets (as a client).
You can upload sheet music to your "library", edit information for each file (such as composer name, a description, and an image), and create tags to organize your music scores.
#### Future Roadmap
- Availability and synchronicity of scores on all devices
- Note-taking functionality that saves across devices
- Possible desktop app
