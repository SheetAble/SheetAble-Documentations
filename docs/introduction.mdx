# Introduction
SheetAble is an easy to use music sheet organiser for all the music enthusiasts out there. 
Currently, the only client is on the web. But, the goal always has been to have SheetAble available on all devices, with the functionality to make notes onto your pdfs and have them stored on your home server. 
It is still beong debated if there should be a Desktop app along with the website. If you'd like to share your opinion on that topic, or many more, go ahead and join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/QnFbxyPbRj).
