# Installation
You can either install SheetAble with Docker or natively on your machine. We would highly suggest using Docker since it is more flexible. However, if you do not have Docker installed or just want to test SheetAble quickly, you can do that without any problems too.

:::danger Binary updates
**Be aware!** If you install it as a binary it will not automatically update for you, which could lead to security issues or simply missing out on new functions.
